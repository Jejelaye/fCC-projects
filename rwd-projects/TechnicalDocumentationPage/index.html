        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
          CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1 and CSS2 and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.

      <p>
        <h2>Advantages of CSS</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>CSS saves time</b> - You can write CSS once and then reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many web pages as you want.</li>
            <li><b>Pages load faster</b> - If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So, less code means faster download times.</li>
            <li><b>Easy maintenance</b> - To make a global change, simply change the style, and all the elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.</li>
            <li><b>Superior styles to HTML</b> - CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
            <li><b>Multiple Device Compatibility</b> - Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cellphones or for printing.</li>
            <li><b>Global web standards</b> – Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So it’s a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible with future browsers.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

    <secion class="main-section" id="Syntax">
      <header><b>Syntax</b></header>
      <p>
          A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts:
          <ul>
            <li><b>Selector:</b> A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;table&gt; etc.</li>
            <li><b>Property:</b> A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Value:</b> Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have the value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows:
          <code>
            selector {
              property: value
            }
          </code> <br>
          <b>Example: </b> You can define a table border as follows: 
          <code>
            table {
              border: 1px solid #000;
            }
          </code><br>
          Here table is a selector and border is a property and the given value 1px solid #C00 is the value of that property.

          You can define selectors in various simple ways based on your comfort. Let me put these selectors one by one.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of selectors</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Tag selectors</b><br>
        <code>
          h1 {
            color: #ff0f0f;
          }
        </code><br>
        <b>Universal selector</b><br>
        <code>
          * {
            font-family: Helvetica;
          }
        </code><br>
        <b>Descendant selectors:</b> to apply a style rule to a particular element only when it lies inside a particular element. <br>
        <code>
          p ul {
            color: #ff0f0f;
          }
        </code><br>
        <b>Class selector</b><br>
        <code>
          .black {
            font-family: Helvetica;
          }
        </code><br>
        <b>Id selector</b> <br>
        <code>
          #purple {
            font-family: Helvetica;
          }
        </code>
